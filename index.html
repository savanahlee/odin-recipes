<h2>A meal that can be accomplished without a single measuring cup or spoon</h2><br>
If you like to eyeball your way through the kitchen, these recipes will bring you frivolous joy.<br><br>
<h3>An appetizer to get the angst out.</h3><br>

            Alright so maybe there was a little bit of measuring in the dessert, but desserts are always demanding and high maintenance, <br>
            and this one allows for that wiggle room enough that you can eyeball wihout a measuring cup and still have<br>
            a good tasting situation.<br><br>
            Any of these recipies are forgiving and able to shoulder some ballpark general measuring.  Also you can vary creatively <br>
            such as spices with the chicken, any sides that love to hang out with gravy for the meatballs, mashed potatoes,egg noodles, <br>
            a side of veggies, so forth. The monkey bread can be mixed with nuts for exta nutritianal value .  <br><br>
            No endless list of ingredience and no dogmatic rules setting you up for failure, yet people will be coming back again and again for another bite.<br><br>
            <h2>ENJOY!</h2><br><br>
