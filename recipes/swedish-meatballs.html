<h3>Description</h3>
<p>In an onion based gravy, this is a fun twist on meatballs that can go over mashed potatos or just by themselves as a side dish. Passing by the pot that can easily be adjusted to small or larger batches, people will be reaching for another meatball all day. It can simmer on a stovetop, or it can be carted around in a crockpot to the next pot luck. You can make it in advanced and freeze this dish that reheats beautifully.</p>
<p>There is room for subtle creative variations which is why there are general measurments.  Some may like a more meaty meatball while others may like a more bready consistancy.  The gravy can be thickened to any degree, although it helps to remember that as the flour liquidy paste is put into the pan, it does take some a small pocket of time to thicken so attend to the dish at this step and slowly add more as a few minutes transpire
    to see true consistancy.  What is important is to mix the cold water and flour first and them add to hot liquid as just putting flour into hot water will create lumps and no one likes lumps.  This is a loose paste, more towards liquidy than solid paste to again avoid those lumps. Size of meatballs can also vary from cocktail bite sized to several inches depending on side or main dish.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>couple of eggs</li>
<li>a small (or larger) container bread crumbs, Italian  style</li>
<li>Enough milk</li>
<li>2 packages dried onion soup mix</li>
<li>salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste preference</li>
<li>Medium or larger sized package of 93% lean ground beef</li>
<li>flour for thickening</li>
</ul><br><br>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol> 
<li>In a large bowl, add  eggs and enough milk to make the bread crumbs very moist, a bit on the thinner side as<br>
it will thicken as the bread soaks in the liquid.  Let sit for 5 minutes at least.</li>
<li>Add ground beef and mix with hands. Ratio of bread crumb mix to ground beef can vary to taste and desired texture.</li>
<li>Roll 2-3 inch meatballs and place onto a baking sheet and shake the salt, pepper and garic powder to taste.  Place in oven at 350 degrees, roatating once until browned.<br>
Note that the goal is to brown the meatballs, allowing them to finish cooking in the gravy.</li>
<li>In a large sauce pan, heat the onion mix, both packages for more savory flavor, to enough water to cover meatballs.</li>
<li>Simmer on low for at least one hour, noting the longer simmering time, the more infused the flavor into the meatballs.</li>
<li>After an hour, take the flour and mix seperately with cold water to form loose paste and continue to mix into the gravy until desired thickness</li>
</ol>
